# Soud Support

Support classes and functions for PHP projects. I find myself reusing these
over and over again, so I figured I might as well put them into a package
instead of constantly (Ha!) recreating them every time.

Needless to say, this is a work in progress. Contents may change without
prior warning or notice.
